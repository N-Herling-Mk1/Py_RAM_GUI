## üß∞ Requirements

Make sure the following Python packages are installed:

```bash
pip install pyqt6 psutil pyinstaller
```


## üöÄ Want to make an an executable?
# Build executable with PyInstaller

# 1. Install PyInstaller (if not already installed)
pip install pyinstaller

# 2. Create the executable (one-file bundle, console hidden)
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=stonks_up.ico RAM_gui.py

# Explanation:
# --onefile       : Bundles everything into a single .exe file
# --windowed      : Prevents a console window from opening (for GUI apps)
# --icon          : Sets the application icon (make sure stonks_up.ico is in the same folder)
# RAM_gui.py      : Your main Python script

# 3. After running, the executable will be located in the 'dist' folder.
#    You can run it directly from there:
#    dist\RAM_gui.exe
